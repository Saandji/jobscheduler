# JobScheduler Library

A lightweight, coroutine-based Kotlin job scheduler that supports:

- One-time and delayed jobs
- Retry policies (fixed or exponential backoff)
- Cancellation and lifecycle management
- Java and Kotlin interop with type-safe result casting

This library was designed to be minimal, clean, and easily extendable.

---

## Project Goals

- Keep dependencies minimal (Kotlin stdlib + coroutines only)
- Be usable from both Java and Kotlin clients easily
- Support a flexible configuration surface
- Stay lightweight, pluggable, and production-ready

# Short-term Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Core Scheduler

| Task                                                       | Status | Notes                                 |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------|
| Create core `Scheduler` API                                | ‚úÖ Done | Exposed via `CoroutineScheduler`      |
| Implement in-memory scheduler (`CoroutineScheduler`)       | ‚úÖ Done | CoroutineScope with SupervisorJob     |
| Basic job lifecycle: schedule, run, complete, fail, cancel | ‚úÖ Done | Full lifecycle states tracked         |
| Retry system (fixed + exponential backoff)                 | ‚úÖ Done | With configurable retry policies      |
| Graceful handling of cancellation (`CANCELLED` status)     | ‚úÖ Done | Cancelled jobs reported correctly     |
| Return `JobHandle` to users                                | ‚úÖ Done | Includes cancel, getStatus, and await |
| Java/Kotlin interoperability (`resultType: Class<T>`)      | ‚úÖ Done | Clean result casting for Java clients |
| Minimal sample app to verify behavior                      | ‚úÖ Done | Schedules, cancels, and awaits jobs   |
| In-memory job store (initial)                              | ‚úÖ Done | Basic in-memory ConcurrentHashMap     |
